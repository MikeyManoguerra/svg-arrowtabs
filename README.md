The svg file is the original exported file from figma.

I modified it slightly by combining the paths made from the joined shapes for each section

I added classes to the relevant polygons in the html file so i could target them with css.

In the real world, we'd still want to keep the svg in asset files and import them into html I think, this is just a quick example.
